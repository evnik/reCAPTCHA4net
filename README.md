# About reCAPTCHA4net
reCAPTCHA4net is a fork of [Recaptcha for .NET](http://recaptchanet.codeplex.com/) project. It allows to easily integrate [Google reCAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/index.html) service into ASP.NET web application. Both Web Forms or ASP.NET MVC are supported. While reCAPTCHA4net has full backward compatibility with the *Recaptcha for .NET* assemblies, it supports updated reCAPTCHA API, which provides the [No CAPTCHA experience](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html).
